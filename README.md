# Practice Project - Food Order App
This project was built while i was taking the "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)"
course at Udemy.
I have built this project while coding along with the course instructor in order to implement the new things i've learned. 

# Project's aim
The project's aim is to practice the new skills i have learned in that Udemy course by building a front-end web app that lets you add/remove items that were fetched from a Firebase database to a cart and clculate the total amount.

# Technologies 
This is a front-end project that was built using create-react-app.
In this project i used several react hooks such as - useState, useContext, useRef, useEffect.
CSS modules concept was implemented in this project as well.
